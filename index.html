			<div class="cards"> 
				<div class="card">
					<img src="images/custom.jpg" alt="Custom Bra for a Breast Cancer survivor" id="custom">
					<p>Everyone knows that <strong>human beings are not symmetrical</strong>; sometimes we have two slightly different eyes, or two nostrils of different sizes and it is <strong>possible and frequent</strong> that our breasts are also <strong>asymmetrical.</strong> 
					Moreover, in 2020 for example, more than <strong>2.2 million cases of breast cancer</strong> have been reported (which makes it the most common cancer) and most of the time, to treat this cancer, <strong>a part or the whole</strong> affected breast is removed.
					I decided to create this brand for these two reasons. 
					Most of the time, bras are not adapted to our morphology. <strong>My team and I want to make this undergarment, often described as uncomfortable, enjoyable to wear.</strong>
